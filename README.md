# **ExpressBones**

ExpressBones is a lightweight file structure for [expressJs](http://expressjs.com/).
It's good to use ExpressBones with any app (MVC / non-MVC / MEAN-stack / etc).

## Why ?

As a person who really matters in file structures and organisation,
i always try to do my best and find the most intuitive/efficient way ordering data.
Sometimes I the basic-exemple or the generators doesn't fit my needs or aren't intuitive enough,
that's the point of this file structure.
Folders matters.

So I decided to make my own "Bones" series.

## Status

This structure is **done**
However I'll add stuff if it makes sense.

## Documentation

Documentation is planned one day (or look at express docs)...
